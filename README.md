### Mandatory
Responsive Web Design
Mobile devices are an important part of everyday life. People want to be able to browse the internet, and access the information they need, from their favorite devices without any headaches or second-guessing. Responsive web design automatically adapts a web store tothe mobile device that’s being used without distorting the view.
Speedy Page Loading Online shoppers want convenience – and they won’t stick around if a page takes forever to load. The online shopping experience should be seamless and easy. If load time is too long or functionality is clunky, shoppers will be gone with a quick click of the mouse.

### Product Details
Online shopping can be a leap of faith – a shopper can’t physically pick up and feel merchandise before they buy, like they would in a brick and mortar store. But shoppers still want to familiarize themselves with what you have to offer. Include informative features on product pages such as high-res photos; in-depth product descriptions;

### Search and Filter
Some customers know precisely what they’re looking for – which is why it’s important to provide them with a focused shopping approach with searching and filtering functionality. A search bar or box helps customers instantly locate what they need. Other features such as search word auto-fill and searching by the most used words support efficient searching. The ability to filter products by different attributes also helps to quickly narrow down products to meet a customer’s desired criteria.

### Customer Reviews
Shoppers want to hear from real people about their product experiences to see if the product fits their desires and expectations. Build trust with your shoppers by posting customer product reviews on your site. And while positive reviews are helpful, don’t be afraid to post negative reviews, too – your transparency creates credibility on the honesty of your brand

### Powerful Shopping Cart
A shopping cart isn’t just a place for customers to store items pending checkout – it’s another important touchpoint that can deliver additional conversion opportunities. Cross selling at checkout helps target customers more precisely with products they are likely to be interested in based on the items already in their cart – which can in turn increase the purchase total.
Total visibility into the products awaiting purchase and their costs (including shipping and sales tax) keeps customers aware, and decreases the likelihood of abandonment.

### Simple Checkout
Don’t let a complicated or lengthy checkout process make customers abandon their shopping cart at the last minute. Fields that the customers can fill out by choice on the form (such as signing up for a newsletter); pre-filling forms; a progress bar for multiple steps/pages; and the ability to store credit card information for repeat shoppers helps to minimize frustration.

### Visible Contact Info
The quicker you answer a customer’s question, the quicker they move forward with the purchase process. Prominently displaying your contact info on your store helps customers know where to turn for a quick resolution to their queries. You will have to implement Back-End system using  NodeJs/ExpressJs and create REST API with appropriate URL endpoints  for administration dashboard interface, Technology used for dashboard is ReactJs and other useful libraries of your choice. Technology used for Front-End is ReactJs and you should implement functionalities listed above .
